# GridGen
A genetic simulation of a population trying to recreate an image as best as possible. The simulation will run at will, and for each generation will display the best individual in the population.

## How to use
Upload an image with the button on the top left corner of the screen. The two sliders below the images control the density of the recreated image and the population size. The simulation will start automatically when you upload an image.
After tweaking the parameters, please restart the simulation through the given button.

Note that the simulation is not perfect, but it can get better results with a higher population count and higher densities. Ramping up the population size and lowering the density will however degrade the simulation's performance. Use at your own risk.

A faster Java version is coming soon!

This simulation was created by Giulio Smedile.
The wonderful CSS template system.css was used to style the page.
The simulation has been heavily inspired by Daniel Shiffman's The Nature of Code book and his amazing YouTube channel.
Also huge thanks to the p5.js community and the Processing Foundation.
